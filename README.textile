h1. pulsar.lua

A generic a-star implementation for Lua.

h1. Usage

TBD


h1. Installation

Just copy the pulsar.lua file wherever you want it (for example on a lib/ folder). Then write this in any Lua file where you want to use it:

<pre>require 'pulsar'</pre>

The @package.path@ variable must be configured so that the folder in which pulsar.lua is copied is available, of course.

Please make sure that you read the license, too (for your convenience it's now included at the beginning of the pulsar.lua file).

h1. Specs

This project uses "telescope":https://github.com/norman/telescope for its specs. If you want to run the specs, you will have to install telescope first. Then just execute the following from the root inspect folder:

<pre>
tsc -f spec/*.lua
</pre>
